# Foundations-of-Deep-Learning
 Welcome to the Foundations of Deep Learning course! This course covers the fundamental concepts and techniques used in deep learning, including neural networks, convolutional networks, recurrent networks, and more.

This repository contains all the course materials you'll need to complete the course, including lecture notes, assignments, example code, and data sets. You'll also find documentation on how to set up your environment, run the code examples, and complete the assignments.

### Getting Started
To get started with the course, you'll need to have some prior experience with Python programming and linear algebra. You'll also need to have a working installation of Python 3 and the Pytorch deep learning library. 


### Contributing
If you find a bug please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. We welcome contributions from the community!
